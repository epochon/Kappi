## PROJECT - A LEGAL AI ASSISTANT
An AI-powered legal assistant that explains real-world case timelines and connects users to suitable lawyers in India.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In India, people seeking legal help are often misled by generic AI systems that only state legal sections and maximum punishments, while hiding the reality of long judicial delays. This creates unnecessary fear or false expectations. At the same time, many qualified young lawyers struggle to get real case opportunities.

We propose a single deliberative Generative AI agent that first analyzes a user’s legal case, explains the realistic time delays commonly observed in the Indian legal system as factual information (with uncertainty awareness), and then assistively suggests suitable young lawyers based on case requirements. The agent reasons in structured phases, evaluates confidence and fairness, and refuses only when providing precise predictions or advice would be unsafe or unethical.

## SOLUTION OVERVIEW
We propose a deliberative Legal AI agent that provides realistic, transparent, and responsible legal assistance.

The agent:
- Analyzes a user’s legal query in structured reasoning phases
- Explains commonly observed judicial timelines and delays in the Indian legal system as factual, uncertainty-aware information
- Explicitly communicates confidence levels and risk factors instead of absolute predictions
- Assistively suggests suitable young lawyers based on case requirements, domain relevance, and fairness principles

The system is designed to prioritize user trust and ethical AI behavior. It deliberately refuses to provide precise predictions or prescriptive legal advice when such outputs would be unsafe, misleading, or unethical.
