# Project: [LEGAL AI ASSISTANT]

## An AI agent bridging legal reality and accessible justice.
This deliberative AI agent bridges the gap between legal information and legal action. By providing realistic timelines and connecting people with qualified young lawyers . We create a more transparent accessible and trustworthy legal assistant system.

## Problem Statement:
In India, people seeking legal help are often misled by generic AI systems that only state legal sections and maximum punishments, while hiding the reality of long judicial delays. This creates unnecessary fear or false expectations. At the same time, many qualified young lawyers struggle to get real case opportunities.

We propose a single deliberative Generative AI agent that first analyzes a user’s legal case, explains the realistic time delays commonly observed in the Indian legal system as factual information (with uncertainty awareness), and then assistively suggests suitable young lawyers based on case requirements. The agent reasons in structured phases, evaluates confidence and fairness, and refuses only when providing precise predictions or advice would be unsafe or unethical.
